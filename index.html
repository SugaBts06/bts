        <p>My hobby is swimming,when I was 4 years old I did not know swimming but I still kep't practicing until one day I was with my friend in the swimming pool I learnt it by my self suddenly I got suprised then my father taught me how to float and helped me swim more. after few months I joined a class and I kep't practicing practicing. After few years, my school my swimming teacher encouraged me to swim I swam all the time after school I spent 2 hours with my coach practicing swimming and now I am very good in swimmming and my dream is to become a olyampic swimmer and win gold medal for India. </p>

    <p>
    I told you that I don't read many books but yes I do read some books. My favourite books are secret seven and wimpy kid. I like secret seven because it goes to mystry slowly and it gets interesting. It has a lot of adventure in it. Then comes wimpy kid,I like it cause the charecter who is wimy kid is just silly like me so I like silly people just like me. I don't read so many books so this is all I can say.

        My inspiration might be weird for you but not for me. My inspiration is a cricketer though I like swimming cause this cricketer taught me how to be confident and he will always be my inspiration.
